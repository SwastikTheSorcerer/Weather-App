## 📡 How It Works

1. The user types a city name in the input field.
2. On clicking the search button, the app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
3. The API responds with weather data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
4. The app updates the UI dynamically to display this information in a neat card.
